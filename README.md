## My process

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
I have learnt a lot from this challenge. I am able to position the conponent to the center of the screen.
The design is also mobile first which is made posible with the ```css``` flexbox properties.
One major thing I had challenges with was the the alignment of the text at the bottom of the image. But with careful analysis of the design template, I was able to align the text correctly.


```html
<!-- The whole content is wrapped in a container -->
<div class="qr-container">
  ...
</div>
```
```css
.qr-container {
  display:flex;
}
```
### Continued development
I want to focus more on the layout of contents and the design break points.
